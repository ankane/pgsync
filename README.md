# pgsync

Sync data from one Postgres database to another (like `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`). Designed for:

- **speed** - tables are transferred in parallel
- **security** - built-in methods to prevent sensitive data from ever leaving the server
- **flexibility** - gracefully handles schema differences, like missing columns and extra columns
- **convenience** - sync partial tables, groups of tables, and related records

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/pgsync/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ankane/pgsync/actions)

## Installation

pgsync is a command line tool. To install, run:

```sh
gem install pgsync
```

This will give you the `pgsync` command. If installation fails, you may need to install [dependencies](#dependencies).

You can also install it with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install pgsync
```

### Docker

Get the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ankane/pgsync) with:

```sh
docker pull ankane/pgsync
alias pgsync="docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/opt -w='/opt' ankane/pgsync"
```

This will give you the `pgsync` command. Note the current working dir. is mounted inside the container.

## Setup

In your project directory, run:

```sh
pgsync --init
```

This creates `.pgsync.yml` for you to customize. We recommend checking this into your version control (assuming it doesn’t contain sensitive information). `pgsync` commands can be run from this directory or any subdirectory.

## How to Use

First, make sure your schema is set up in both databases. We recommend using a schema migration tool for this, but pgsync also provides a few [convenience methods](#schema). Once that’s done, you’re ready to sync data.

Sync tables

```sh
pgsync
```

Sync specific tables

```sh
pgsync table1,table2
```

Works with wildcards as well

```sh
pgsync "table*"
```

Sync specific rows (existing rows are overwritten)

```sh
pgsync products "where store_id = 1"
```

You can also preserve existing rows

```sh
pgsync products "where store_id = 1" --preserve
```

Or truncate them

```sh
pgsync products "where store_id = 1" --truncate
```

## Tables

Exclude specific tables

```sh
pgsync --exclude table1,table2
```

Add to `.pgsync.yml` to exclude by default

```yml
exclude:
  - table1
  - table2
```

Sync tables from all schemas or specific schemas (by default, only the search path is synced)

```sh
pgsync --all-schemas
# or
pgsync --schemas public,other
# or
pgsync public.table1,other.table2
```

## Groups

Define groups in `.pgsync.yml`:

```yml
groups:
  group1:
    - table1
    - table2
```

And run:

```sh
pgsync group1
```

## Variables

You can also use groups to sync a specific record and associated records in other tables.

To get product `123` with its reviews, last 10 coupons, and store, use:

```yml
groups:
  product:
    products: "where id = {1}"
    reviews: "where product_id = {1}"
    coupons: "where product_id = {1} order by created_at desc limit 10"
    stores: "where id in (select store_id from products where id = {1})"
```

And run:

```sh
pgsync product:123
```

## Schema

Sync the schema before the data (this wipes out existing data)

```sh
pgsync --schema-first
```

Specify tables

```sh
pgsync table1,table2 --schema-first
```

Sync the schema without data (this wipes out existing data)

```sh
pgsync --schema-only
```

pgsync does not try to sync Postgres extensions.

## Sensitive Data

Prevent sensitive data like email addresses from leaving the remote server.

Define rules in `.pgsync.yml`:

```yml
data_rules:
  email: unique_email
  last_name: random_letter
  birthday: random_date
  users.auth_token:
    value: secret
  visits_count:
    statement: "(RANDOM() * 10)::int"
  encrypted_*: null
```

`last_name` matches all columns named `last_name` and `users.last_name` matches only the users table. Wildcards are supported, and the first matching rule is applied.

Options for replacement are:

- `unique_email`
- `unique_phone`
- `unique_secret`
- `random_letter`
- `random_int`
- `random_date`
- `random_time`
- `random_ip`
- `value`
- `statement`
- `null`
- `untouched`

Rules starting with `unique_` require the table to have a single column primary key. `unique_phone` requires a numeric primary key.

## Foreign Keys

Foreign keys can make it difficult to sync data. Three options are:

1. Defer constraints (recommended)
2. Manually specify the order of tables
3. Disable foreign key triggers, which can silently break referential integrity (not recommended)

To defer constraints, use:

```sh
pgsync --defer-constraints
```

To manually specify the order of tables, use `--jobs 1` so tables are synced one-at-a-time.

```sh
pgsync table1,table2,table3 --jobs 1
```

To disable foreign key triggers and potentially break referential integrity, use:

```sh
pgsync --disable-integrity
```

This requires superuser privileges on the `to` database. If syncing to (not from) Amazon RDS, use the `rds_superuser` role. If syncing to (not from) Heroku, there doesn’t appear to be a way to disable integrity.

## Triggers

Disable user triggers with:

```sh
pgsync --disable-user-triggers
```

## Sequences

Skip syncing sequences with:

```sh
pgsync --no-sequences
```

## Append-Only Tables

For extremely large, append-only tables, sync in batches.

```sh
pgsync large_table --in-batches
```

The script will resume where it left off when run again, making it great for backfills.

## Connection Security

Always make sure your [connection is secure](https://ankane.org/postgres-sslmode-explained) when connecting to a database over a network you don’t fully trust. Your best option is to connect over SSH or a VPN. Another option is to use `sslmode=verify-full`. If you don’t do this, your database credentials can be compromised.

## Safety

To keep you from accidentally overwriting production, the destination is limited to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` by default.

To use another host, add `to_safe: true` to your `.pgsync.yml`.

## Multiple Databases

To use with multiple databases, run:

```sh
pgsync --init db2
```

This creates `.pgsync-db2.yml` for you to edit. Specify a database in commands with:

```sh
pgsync --db db2
```

## Integrations

- [Django](#django)
- [Heroku](#heroku)
- [Laravel](#laravel)
- [Rails](#rails)

### Django

If you run `pgsync --init` in a Django project, migrations will be excluded in `.pgsync.yml`.

```yml
exclude:
  - django_migrations
```

### Heroku

If you run `pgsync --init` in a Heroku project, the `from` database will be set in `.pgsync.yml`.

```yml
from: $(heroku config:get DATABASE_URL)?sslmode=require
```

### Laravel

If you run `pgsync --init` in a Laravel project, migrations will be excluded in `.pgsync.yml`.

```yml
exclude:
  - migrations
```

### Rails

If you run `pgsync --init` in a Rails project, Active Record metadata and schema migrations will be excluded in `.pgsync.yml`.

```yml
exclude:
  - ar_internal_metadata
  - schema_migrations
```

## Debugging

To view the SQL that’s run, use:

```sh
pgsync --debug
```

## Other Commands

Help

```sh
pgsync --help
```

Version

```sh
pgsync --version
```

List tables

```sh
pgsync --list
```

## Scripts

Use groups when possible to take advantage of parallelism.

For Ruby scripts, you may need to do:

```rb
Bundler.with_unbundled_env do
  system "pgsync ..."
end
```

## Dependencies

If installation fails, your system may be missing Ruby or libpq.

On Mac, run:

```sh
brew install libpq
```

On Ubuntu, run:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev libpq-dev build-essential
```

## Upgrading

Run:

```sh
gem install pgsync
```

To use master, run:

```sh
gem install specific_install
gem specific_install https://github.com/ankane/pgsync.git
```

With Homebrew, run:

```sh
brew upgrade pgsync
```

With Docker, run:

```sh
docker pull ankane/pgsync
```
